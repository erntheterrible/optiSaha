# Notes Editor Specification

## Overview

The new Notes editor is designed to provide users with a rich, interactive, and flexible note-taking experience. Moving beyond a simple text editor, the new interface offers a block-based editing system that allows users to create structured, visually rich content with ease.

## Key Features
